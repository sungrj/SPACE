An iOS Approach to Smart Parking At JMU using a Cloud Environment

Students aimlessly search for parking all across James Madison University (JMU) campus. As a cheap alternative to constructing more parking lots, Smart Parking using the Cloud Environment (SPACE) will aim to solve this problem. Using Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) to count cars entering and exiting parking lots, we are able to accurately, at near real-time, provide parking lot specific information to drivers. These cars will be equipped with smart tags replacing current parking passes which can provide our system with detailed information of the car to better evaluate which spots will likely be filled, such as handicap or teacher/student spots.  Users will simply open the SPACE iOS mobile application to check the current parking lot or structure availability of their choosing to best determine where to park. Beyond the average consumer use, the iOS mobile app also has the functionality for JMU Parking Services to manage parking lots, being able to create, update, or delete parking lots. A full administrative component allows system administrators to login and edit lot information as well as add or delete a lot from the database. New administrators can be easily created via the same interface. Our database is stored in the Cloud in a secure storage.
